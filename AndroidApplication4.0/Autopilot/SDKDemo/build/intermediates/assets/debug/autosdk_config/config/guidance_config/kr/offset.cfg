#This file provides the estimated time it takes for certain types of guidance to be spoken via TTS. 
# Example: 
# InfoWithDistance=3920 which is in milliseconds. 
# We assume that to announce the sentence "Proceed <distance> on the < current motorway name>.", TTS needs 3.92 seconds to finish it. 
# The audio module uses this value to calculate a predicted distance ahead of the maneuver point to play the guidance.
